/**
 * A Buffer represents a sequence of zero or more bytes that can be written to or read from, and which expands as
 * necessary to accommodate any bytes written to it.<p>
 * There are two ways to write data to a Buffer: The first method involves methods that take the form {@code setXXX}.
 * These methods write data into the buffer starting at the specified position. The position does not have to be inside data that
 * has already been written to the buffer; the buffer will automatically expand to encompass the position plus any data that needs
 * to be written. All positions are measured in bytes and start with zero.<p>
 * The second method involves methods that take the form {@code appendXXX}; these methods append data
 * at the end of the buffer.<p>
 * Methods exist to both {@code set} and {@code append} all primitive types, {@link java.lang.String}, {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} and
 * other instances of Buffer.<p>
 * Data can be read from a buffer by invoking methods which take the form {@code getXXX}. These methods take a parameter
 * representing the position in the Buffer from where to read data.<p>
 * Once a buffer has been written to a socket or other write stream, the same buffer instance can't be written again to another WriteStream.<p>
 * Instances of this class are not thread-safe.<p>
