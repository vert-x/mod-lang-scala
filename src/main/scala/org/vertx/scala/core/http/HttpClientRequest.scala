/**
 * Represents a client-side HTTP request.<p>
 * Instances are created by an [[org.vertx.scala.core.http.HttpClient]] instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 * specific HTTP methods, or the generic [[org.vertx.scala.core.http.HttpClient.request]] method.<p>
 * Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once
 * you are ready to send the request, the `end()` method should be called.<p>
 * Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The [[org.vertx.scala.core.http.HttpClient]]
 * instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available in the pool. Any requests
 * sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent when an HTTP connection becomes
 * available from the pool.<p>
 * The headers of the request are actually sent either when the `end()` method is called, or, when the first
 * part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.<p>
 * This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.<p>
 * It implements [[org.vertx.java.core.streams.WriteStream]] so it can be used with
 * [[org.vertx.java.core.streams.Pump]] to pump data with flow control.<p>
 * An example of using this class is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * val req = httpClient.post("/some-url", { (response: HttpClientResponse) =>
 *   println("Got response: " + response.statusCode)
 * })
 *
 * req.headers().put("some-header", "hello")
 *     .put("Content-Length", 5)
 *     .write(new Buffer(Array[Byte](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))
 *     .write(new Buffer(Array[Byte](6, 7, 8, 9, 10)))
 *     .end()
 *
 * </pre>
 * Instances of HttpClientRequest are not thread-safe.
