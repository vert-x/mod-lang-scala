/**
 * Sometimes it is desirable to share immutable data between different event loops, for example to implement a
 * cache of data.<p>
 * This class allows instances of shared data structures to be looked up and used from different event loops.<p>
 * The data structures themselves will only allow certain data types to be stored into them. This shields you from
 * worrying about any thread safety issues might occur if mutable objects were shared between event loops.<p>
 * The following types can be stored in a shareddata data structure:<p>
 * <pre>
 *   [[java.lang.String]]
 *   [[java.lang.Integer]]
 *   [[java.lang.Long]]
 *   [[java.lang.Double]]
 *   [[java.lang.Float]]
 *   [[java.lang.Short]]
 *   [[java.lang.Byte]]
 *   [[java.lang.Character]]
 *   `byte[]` - this will be automatically copied, and the copy will be stored in the structure.
 *   [[org.vertx.scala.core.buffer.Buffer]] - this will be automatically copied, and the copy will be stored in the
 *   structure.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe.<p>
