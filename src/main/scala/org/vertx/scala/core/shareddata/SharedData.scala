/**
 * Sometimes it is desirable to share immutable data between different event loops, for example to implement a
 * cache of data.<p>
 * This class allows instances of shared data structures to be looked up and used from different event loops.<p>
 * The data structures themselves will only allow certain data types to be stored into them. This shields you from
 * worrying about any thread safety issues might occur if mutable objects were shared between event loops.<p>
 * The following types can be stored in a shareddata data structure:<p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@link String}
 *   {@link Integer}
 *   {@link Long}
 *   {@link Double}
 *   {@link Float}
 *   {@link Short}
 *   {@link Byte}
 *   {@link Character}
 *   {@code byte[]} - this will be automatically copied, and the copy will be stored in the structure.
 *   {@link org.vertx.java.core.buffer.Buffer} - this will be automatically copied, and the copy will be stored in the
 *   structure.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe.<p>
