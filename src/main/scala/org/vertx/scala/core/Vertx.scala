 * The control centre of the Vert.x Core API.<p>
 * You should normally only use a single instance of this class throughout

 * If you are using Vert.x embedded, you can create an instance using one of
 * the static core package `newVertx` methods.<p>
 * This class acts as a factory for TCP/SSL and HTTP/HTTPS servers and clients,
 * SockJS servers, and provides an instance of the event bus, file system and
 * shared data classes, as well as methods for setting and cancelling timers.<p>
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe.<p>
